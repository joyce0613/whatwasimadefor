In the article “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression: White Femininity, Generation Z, and Whisper Singing,” Associate Professor of Musicology Jessica A. Holmes explores Eilish’s relationship to depression, her rejection of hyperfemininity, and the criticism of aestheticized sadness. Holmes situates Eilish’s role in the larger discussion of gender, mental illness, and pop culture through a deep dive into her musicality, lyricism, and signature vocal style of “whisper singing” (Holmes 2023, 789). This analysis emphasizes Eilish’s ability to recognize and accept emotional ambiguity as she openly shares the challenges that come with her gender-neutral aesthetic choices. She discusses her own search for identity and her battle with mental illness, projecting herself as a relatable and genuine figure, making her a source of comfort for listeners experiencing similar confusions. In doing so, the audience is brought to consider the greater issue of contemporary pop culture’s often passive engagement with the topics of mental illness, gender identity, and what it means to be authentic in modern pop culture. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holmes begins by positioning Eilish as a cultural icon with the public persona of a “sad girl,” an aesthetic widely popular on social media platforms such as Tumblr and Instagram in the 2010s (Holmes 2023, 809). This aesthetic embraces sadness and melancholy, beautifies them, and then warps them into forms of self-expression and self-optimization. In projecting these vulnerable images to public domains, there is a sense of empowerment and encouragement. For the young female audience who may resonate with the presented struggles and experiences, this aesthetic can be particularly reassuring. As Holmes discusses, female adolescent-related depression is often disregarded for the emotional instability and moodiness that are stereotypically linked to female menstruation, a notion that has been “weaponized against young women” (Holmes 2023, 802). Holmes connects Eilish’s image to this shift in musical aesthetics, suggesting the significant role she has played in amplifying a generational shift in society’s perception of depression. Rather than being “dismissed, ridiculed, or catastrophized,” Eilish’s ASMR-like and soft productions offer listeners a sense of intimacy and comfort as she sings about mental illnesses (Holmes 2023, 787). Her popularity, as Holmes writes, grew over the pandemic as numerous listeners resonated with her discussions of physical isolation and mental distress. ASMR became a source for de-stressing during quarantine periods, and Eilish’s unique vocals aligned well with the needs of adolescents during this time of social separations (Holmes 2023, 795). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holmes situates her argument within broader feminist musicology and sound studies, building on scholars who explore how gender and mental health intersect in the public performance of emotion. In particular, her work responds to earlier studies of pop star personas and expands the conversation by examining how Eilish’s public persona resonates with Generation Z’s values. This includes emotional transparency, resistance to gender norms, and a preference for authenticity over traditional pop stardom. According to Holmes, Eilish’s persona as a “sad girl” was likely an attempt to be seen as a more relatable and approachable public figure. She references music scholars such as William Cheng, an Associate Professor of Music at Dartmouth College who focuses on intersections between culture, media, disability studies, and more. Cheng discussed the double standards in how “madness” and mental distress are received between the genders, asserting that the laudation male artists have historically received as a symbol of bravery for their emotional expression is not applied in the same way to female artists (Holmes 2023, 791). According to Holmes, female musicians are often expected to assume the role of being “innocent,” “ingratiating,” “flirtatious,” “perky,” and “cute” (Holmes 2023, 789). In this sense, Eilish’s sullen and soft image makes her stand out from earlier female pop artists. Holmes examines Eilish’s performances, interviews, music videos, and aesthetic branding, analyzing how these public-facing elements contribute to a “sad girl” persona. By identifying how the singer’s preference for oversized, unisex clothing with muted colors functions to deliberately reject the hypersexualized femininity, Holmes underscores the significance of Eilish’s digital branding. With the gradual development of a more inclusive society, Eilish’s unconventional image in mainstream media allows young audiences to resonate deeper with her upon seeing their own styles and identities reflected in public platforms. Furthermore, Eilish’s lowercase typography choices, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when the party’s over</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Party’s Over</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reinforce a casual and informal digital language. This intentional choice signals an alignment with Generation Z’s trends and a state of detached emotions (Holmes 2023, 1). Holmes further asserts that these lowercase letters mirror the quiet, soothing vocal delivery attributed to Eilish’s music. This supports the singer’s presentation as a more authentic and relatable figure, reinforcing the sense of closeness between herself and her audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Holmes acknowledges the deep resonance that the “sad girl” aesthetic has with young women as a form of self-expression, she addresses the significant criticism of this concept as having the potential to glamorize mental illness. The aesthetic, as Holmes discusses, often featured imagery of pale, melancholic women, with tear-streaked selfies, which permeated the 2010s’ social media platforms (Holmes 2023, 809). The mere idea of portraying sadness as an aesthetic and a trend in itself is rooted in marketing behavior and “meme-culture,” which may detract attention away from those who are actually struggling with mental illnesses. However, Holmes does point out that Eilish has repeatedly spoken out against the glamorization of mental illness, insisting that her music is meant to validate rather than glorify depression (Holmes 2023, 810). Holmes’s approach to discussing this criticism is conducted very successfully. She acknowledges the opposing lens that criticizes Eilish’s “sad girl” persona, but also incorporates evidence of the artist and her team clarifying her true intentions, whether by dismissing misread lyrics or promoting greater mental health awareness. By doing so, Holmes presents a balanced argument that does not outright dismiss the concerns surrounding the commodification of sadness.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holmes’s article contributes to ongoing and progressively developing discussions about gender, mental health, and authenticity in popular music. Her thematic approach to presenting her argument, moving from Eilish’s vocal style to her visual branding and lyrical content, makes her argument much more accessible. Each theme builds on the last, supporting the broader narrative of embracing personal identity. Holmes situates Eilish within the “sad girl” aesthetic and greater cultural conversations about gender, mental health, and musical authenticity. In doing so, she offers a nuanced analysis of how Billie Eilish navigates and challenges traditional narratives around depression, femininity, and mental health stigmas, providing the modern Generation Z with a sense of validation in this digital age. This paper brings up the critical discussion of mental health representation in pop culture. It illustrates the complexities of how artists navigate their expression of authentic vulnerability in an era where emotional expression can be either deeply personal, highly marketable, or both.</span></p><p><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-review/">&lt;-- Read: Silence Speaks</a>                                                                 <a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/playlist-and-listening-guide/">A Playlist Journey --&gt;</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-video-and-lyrics/" class="al" target="_self">Music Video &amp; Lyrics</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-review/" class="al" target="_self">Music Review: Silence Speaks</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/critical-reading-assignment/" class="al" target="_self">Pop, Gender, and the &quot;Sad Girl&quot; Aesthetic</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/playlist-and-listening-guide/" class="al" target="_self">A Playlist Journey</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/blog/" class="al" target="_self">A Shared Production</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/bibliography/" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
