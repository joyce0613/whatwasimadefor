As Billie Eilish’s "What was I made for?" played over flashes of girlhood, growing up, and womanhood, tears quickly welled up in my eyes, and I quietly teared up. I wasn’t alone. Around me, I saw my friends and fellow audience members gently dabbing at their eyes, sniffling.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that night, as I casually scrolled through my social media platforms, I was met with numerous edits related to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. My feed with filled with one montage after another, all linked together with the same melancholic voice of Billie Eilish that resounded through my head. These videos contained childhood firsts, teenage recklessness, getting ready with friends, experiencing love, crying through heartbreaks, empowering monologues from female figures, and so much more. I realized that my sudden moment of resonation and outbreak of emotion wasn’t personal but collective. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my social media pages remained occupied by “What was I made for?” along with the numerous videos set against it, it became clear that this song wasn’t a mere part of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> soundtrack anymore. It had become a voice for millions of digital memories and a space for connection. Through the user-generated content on digital platforms, the song has transformed into a collaborative work that was shaped by the interpretations and reimagination of its listeners. </span></p><h1>The Spark of Digital Trends</h1><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was I made for?” quickly asserted its role as one of the top trends following the release of the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movie across various digital platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the biggest trends include:</span></p><h3><strong>Montage of Girlhood</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clips and photo compilations of the ups and downs of the creators’ own experiences of girlhood, depicting experiences highly relatable to many individuals across the world. This trend greatly emulates the montage scene in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> movie. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Below are images taken of a series of photos that TikTok creator @ioannnix posted, depicting her interpretation and experiences with girlhood (@ioannnix 2023).</span></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM.png" alt="" width="2010" height="1222" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM-xs.png 640w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM-sm.png 768w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM-md.png 1024w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM-lg.png 1366w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM-xl.png 1600w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.08.39-PM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><h3><strong>Childhood Nostalgia</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People posted home videos and comparisons between past and present, showing their journey from infancy to adulthood – baby steps, birthday parties, and much more – accompanied by Eilish’s soft vocals.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Below are images taken of a video posted by TikTok creator @pierrettex, who put together a video comparing items from her childhood and their “adult” comparisons. She demonstrates characteristics of her girlhood while also showing growth. For instance, the two images below show the transition from toy makeup used as a young child to adult beauty products (@pierrettex 2023).</span></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM.png" alt="" width="2440" height="1112" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM-xs.png 640w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM-sm.png 768w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM-md.png 1024w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM-lg.png 1366w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM-xl.png 1600w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.09.19-PM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><h3><strong>Exploring Feminism through Pop Culture</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iconic scenes from various films such as Little Women and speeches from female public figures were compiled and remixed with "What was I made for?", highlighting significant feminist figures and the broader feminist narrative.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Example: Below are images taken of a video posted by TikTok creator @editzxmolls, who compiled scenes from the movies </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little Women</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and speeches by Emma Watson and Taylor Swift speaking on topics of feminism (@editzxmolls 2024).</span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM.png" alt="" width="1760" height="1330" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM-xs.png 640w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM-sm.png 768w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM-md.png 1024w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM-lg.png 1366w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM-xl.png 1600w, https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/media/posts/6/responsive/Screenshot-2025-04-16-at-8.10.10-PM-2xl.png 1920w"></figure><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each trend is different, but they all revolve around the central ideas of identity, empathy, growth, and empowerment.</span></p><h1><strong>More Than Just a Trend</strong></h1><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As seen through these examples, this digital activity was far from fleeting. Much of the content garnered millions of interactions. The comments flooded in agreement, and numerous viewers shared their own experiences. One viewer reflected, “I remember at 8, my teacher wanted 'strong boys' to carry the chairs. I pick[ed] up 3 to show I was just as strong, then got called a 'showoff'.” I tell people this story when they ask why [I am] a feminist.” </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another viewer simply commented, “dam[n] why is it so accurate?” in response to @pierrettex’s nostalgic comparison video.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s often easy to dismiss social media as shallow, distracting, or fleeting, but the cultural phenomenon that is this song tells a different story. "What was I made for?" created a space for vulnerability. In today’s digital world, publicly released content can often feel curated, as though filtered and distant. Through this film and song, the audience becomes a part of the content rather than being a mere consumer. This shift demonstrates the creation of raw, real, and deeply emotional connections. This trend was not about going viral, but rather sharing experiences and cultivating community. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as though asking, “Here’s my story – is it yours too?”</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly, the answer has been an overwhelming yes. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Billie Eilish’s song, the user-generated content became a mirror reflecting a generation’s collective uncertainty, hope, and resilience.</span></p><h1><strong>A Living Song</strong></h1><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, when we discuss songs and films, we tend to focus on the creator’s intentions. We ask questions like, what story did Billie Eilish intend to tell? What was Greta Gerwig’s vision for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, “What was I made for?” turns the microphone towards its audience. While Eilish may have projected her own struggles of navigating identity and fame through her song, her listeners hear echoes of their own stories. Through the greatly personal and interpretative nature of the song’s trend, its cultural importance lies less in what was intended. Instead, the spotlight is placed on how the song was received.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This song reminds us that artistic meaning is ever-changing rather than being tied to its significance upon release. Through the modern digitized society, Eilish’s voice ties numerous personal narratives across the world. Seeing the TikTok edits, grainy childhood videos, and comments of encouragement and connection, the song now speaks for its audience. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this sense, “What was I made for?” is almost like that of an unfinished artwork. Rather than a static piece, its meaning is constantly morphed and reinforced as it sounds through the ears of one to another. I guess you could say that we’re all co-writers. Through this collaborative process, we directly witness how identity and feminism are actively shaped through digital culture.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just Eilish’s song anymore. It’s all of ours.</span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/playlist-and-listening-guide/">&lt;-- Playlist &amp; Listening Guide</a>                                                                                  <a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/end-page/">End --&gt;</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/introduction/" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-video-and-lyrics/" class="al" target="_self">Music Video &amp; Lyrics</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-review/" class="al" target="_self">Music Review</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/critical-reading-assignment/" class="al" target="_self">Critical Reading Assignment</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/playlist-and-listening-guide/" class="al" target="_self">Playlist &amp; Listening Guide</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/blog/" class="al" target="_self">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/bibliography/" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
