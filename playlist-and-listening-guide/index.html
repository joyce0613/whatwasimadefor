With that, our emotions ride along. The rollercoaster often begins with a calm introduction, slow, perhaps on a gradual incline. Here, you’re filled with excitement, perhaps apprehension, or maybe it’s regret.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3JNxR4OcqfbObub1Gw06qm?si=8432f2f4437840e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That's where this playlist begins...</a></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the corner of a quiet bedroom with only the sound of the gentle tapping of rain on glass, one looks absentmindedly, expression distant, out into the dull gray skies as Billie Eilish’s “What was I made for?” begins to quietly through the speakers of a laptop.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the centre of this collection of songs is Eilish’s delicate and vulnerable track that whispers the aching question: Who am I meant to be? This seeking to understand one’s identity and purpose is a sentiment that resonates deeply with the very state of being human. Through each track, we come closer to procuring a response to this question, shifting from a sense of nostalgia and reflection on the positive memories of the past to a loss of identity and growing self-doubt, and a final stage of self-acceptance and content. It’s about identity, about searching for something stable in a world that feels increasingly uncertain. This playlist will take listeners through this ride of growth and personal development through its relatable lyrics and gradual acceleration of rhythm, beat, and tension. Each track is placed to build its momentum of emotions, from the moments of stillness, denial, and regrets to a weightless fall to the lowest point before a steady incline back up. This next drop won’t be terrifying anymore, it’ll finish with feelings of exhilaration and joy. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, take a deep breath – the ride is about to begin.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler. “you were good to me” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">brent</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Republic Records: 2019</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06k5XN78OP0?si=HTr4tcUSzMW2-Rlz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opening notes of “you were good to me”  feel like stepping into a memory. The soft piano and hushed vocals of Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler paint a portrait of loss that is both gentle and devastating. The phrase “Now I'm worried for my soul. And I'm still scared of growin' old” reflects the story of looking back on a lost relationship that once felt so warm and close. “You were good to me” is then repeatedly sang throughout, setting the stage for the initial sadness and regret. This first track introduces listeners to the pain from what sits in the past. This is a slow, first step into the stage of uncertainty and doubt.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sia. “Breathe Me” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour the Small One</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Go! Beat: 2004</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ghPcYqn0p4Y?si=IwtZm-gTAlTLZMJf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sia’s trembling voice sounds through with a weight of loneliness as it repeats, “Be my friend, hold me”. “Breathe Me” brings listeners to a stage of feelings of worthlessness and isolation. Followed by a reflection on what is lost through Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler, we are now at the third stage of grief: bargaining. Sia’s vulnerability permeates the song as she pleads to have someone “hold [her]” and “wrap [her] up.” These lyrics sound like an honest confession, a plea to be understood and warmed. This track is the beginning of the spiral into a loss of self, to the stage where Billie Eilish’s “What was I made for?” reflects on this weightless fall. </span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billie Eilish. “What was I made for?” from The Motion Picture </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Atlantic, Darkroom, and Interscope Records: 2023.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cW8VLC9nnTo?si=rE_JWfghquOVEhWx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closely following “Breathe Me” is the center of this compilation: “What was I made for?”. This track lowers the use of instrumentals and turns the focus to Billie Eilish’s raw vocals, which seem to be speaking directly to the audience. She asks the critical question of “What was I made for?” as she is at a loss of identity. The song is almost like a sigh, as Eilish reflects on her own questioning of her feminine identity in the male-dominated music industry and her battle with the consequences of fame at a young age. This track serves to reassure listeners that they are not alone in these feelings of loss of self and place in society.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harry Styles. “Falling” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fine Line</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Erskine Records Limited: 2019.</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olGSAVOkkTI?si=6PtNKRJs9-cq6iFH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As “What was I made for?” wavers with uncertainty, “Falling” plunges. Harry Styles continues Eilish’s sense of self-doubt with falsettos and strong piano chords. This is in tandem with the fourth stage of grief as Styles admits to the loss of previous euphoria and past-self. “What am I now? What if I’m someone I don’t want around?” he sings, echoing Eilish’s existential questions in “What was I made for?”. Although the overall pace of the song remains slow, the intensity deepens as the rhythm picks up from the mellow and slow whispering of Billie Eilish. </span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SZA. “Saturn” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SOS Deluxe: LANA</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Top Dawg Entertainment &amp; RCA Records: 2024. </span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2G8ESoDXm8?si=wB6Fr6CF0Kow0cLY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SZA’s “Saturn” takes a detour and introduces a sense of detachment and the beginning of self-reflection as she sings, “Got to break this pattern / Of floating away”. SZA’s smooth and dreamy vocals emphasize the phrases “There's got to be more, got to be more”, which suggests a sense of longing and desire to move on from past harms and losses. Similarly to Eilish’s ASMR-like vocals, SZA also creates this ethereal atmosphere with her voice. This quality hints at something beyond despair and begins to step away from the slow ballads preceding this track.</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Halsey. “Control” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">BADLANDS</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Astralwerks: 2015</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/so8V5dAli-Q?si=KvKrj-HU4Jwlg-Mf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Halsey’s voice switches between messages of fragility and raw defiance through “Control”. By this track, the beats hit harder, picking up in speed as the atmosphere sharpens with tension. The production is somewhat eerie, and the pulsing beats contribute to a sense of uneasiness. Halsey sings, “I’m bigger than my body / I’m colder than this home,” warping the previous soft questioning of purpose into a sense of empowerment and a climb towards an assertion of power and control. </span></p><blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billie Eilish. “bad guy” from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Darkroom and Interscope Records: 2019</span></p><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyDfgMOUjCI?si=H-CwJu1eULTUIPzH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We began with whispers, ballads, and melancholy, and we’re ending with a smile – or even a smirk. “bad guy” closes off this playlist with a full embracing of power. The heavy bass reverberates an infectious and strong beat as Eilish sings “I’m the bad guy” repeatedly throughout the song. She playfully taunts her partner, provoking them to question their own identity. This piece is in contrast to Eilish’s earlier track in the playlist, there is no more doubt and questioning. Listeners are left with unapologetic confidence. There are no more questions, doubts, regrets – “duh”. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the rollercoaster finishes its final drop, we’re left with pure ecstasy, whether that it was fun or perhaps that the ride is now over. This playlist is a musical representation of personal growth. This is a reflection of the unavoidable experiences of overcoming the obstacles that come our way, but this compilation serves to reassure its listeners and motivate them to emerge from even the lowest lows as someone better. Each track of the playlist is added with intention, and each contributes to the gradual steps towards self-acceptance. By the time we reach the end with Eilish’s “bad guy”, the question to her previous track “What was I made for?” is answered: perhaps there’s not a concrete response, but at this point, listeners are propelled to accept that, like music, we are fluid and ever-evolving. Hopefully, by the end of this playlist, listeners feel less intimidated by the question of identity and feel reminded of this shared human experience as we search for our new answer. </span></p><p class="align-center"><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/critical-reading-assignment/">&lt;-- Critical Reading Assignment </a>                                                                           <a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/blog/">Blog --&gt;</a></p><p> </p><p><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/similar-songs/">Find similar songs here</a></p><p><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/renditions-of-what-was-i-made-for/">Find alternate versions of "What was I made for?" here</a></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/introduction/" class="al" target="_self">Introduction</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-video-and-lyrics/" class="al" target="_self">Music Video &amp; Lyrics</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/music-review/" class="al" target="_self">Music Review</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/critical-reading-assignment/" class="al" target="_self">Critical Reading Assignment</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/playlist-and-listening-guide/" class="al" target="_self">Playlist &amp; Listening Guide</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/blog/" class="al" target="_self">Blog</a></li><li><a href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/bibliography/" class="al" target="_self">Bibliography</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
