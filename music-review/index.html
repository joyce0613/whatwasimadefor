Eilish’s song “What was I made for?”, a delicate yet profound track from the blockbuster film’s soundtrack, solidified its significance in contemporary music by winning two Grammy Awards and an Oscar (Stevens 2024; Recording Academy 2025). By stripping away the song’s studio layers, Billie Eilish’s performance at the 2024 Academy Awards magnified its emotional weight. Her simple yet contemplative delivery transformed the piece from a polished soundtrack into a raw, deeply personal expression of self-discovery.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eilish’s Oscars performance established a melancholic and vulnerable essence that was delivered through her intimate performance. She wasn’t alone in this either – her brother and longtime collaborator, Finneas, accompanied Eilish’s raw vocals with a minimalistic and gentle piano. In contrast to the studio version – which features layered vocals and instrumentals, including piano, strings, percussion, and bass – the Oscars performance relied on a simple accompaniment. While a violin orchestra joined halfway through, its subtle presence allowed Eilish’s vocals to remain the focal point. Eilish’s simplistic approach to her Oscars performance accentuated the song’s lyrical depth, allowing the audience to hear each word enunciated and resonate with the song’s emphasis on the universal feelings of vulnerability and self-doubt. In this way, Eilish’s signature “ASMR-like and whispering” vocals became the performance’s greatest strength (Holmes 2023). She sang with a quiet intensity, leaving purposeful pauses between phrases. These pauses underscored the emotional weight of lyrics like “I used to float/now I just fall down” and “I’m sad again/don’t tell my boyfriend.” By doing so, she gave her audience time to absorb and reflect on each line. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eilish’s Oscars rendition of “What was I made for?” demonstrates that live performances can significantly deepen a song’s emotional resonance. According to music scholar Christopher Small, it is sometimes argued that live performances serve as mere replications of recorded tracks with no greater contribution to the meaning of the musical piece (Small 1998, 5-6). As discussed in his book </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musicking</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, performances are referred to by some scholars as “a one-way system of communication, running from composer to individual listener through the medium of the performer” (Small 1998, 6). However, Eilish’s Oscars version of “What was I made for?” directly challenges this idea. Rather than simply performing the studio-recorded version of the song, Eilish uses live instrumentals and clear vocals to evoke greater contemplation from the audience. Additionally, the Academy Awards became a space for quiet reflection as Billie and Finneas performed. In this way, their performance stood out as a rare moment of vulnerability in an event known for elaborate spectacles and celebrations. This unconventionality emphasizes both their technical music skills and their ability to translate complex emotions into universally felt experiences.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was I made for?” asserted itself as not simply another track in Greta Gerwig’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but an auditory encapsulation of the reflection of identity, purpose, and femininity central to the film. Eilish’s history of introspective songwriting from her songs “when the party’s over” and “happier than ever” has consistently explored themes of emotional alienation. With “What was I made for?” Billie Eilish continues to address the struggle of searching for identity and purpose, highlighting the feelings of isolation that many listeners may resonate with. By speaking about these often stigmatized experiences, Eilish invites listeners to find comfort in knowing that they are not alone in their exploration of emotional complexities. These messages reinforce the introspective quality of her music.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Eilish did not initially recognize the song’s deeply personal nature. Eilish shared with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanity Fair</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that she wrote with “a character” in mind, not herself (Eilish 2023). But it wasn’t until she had completed the song and played it back that she noticed how brutally personal the track was. She realized that she was “the character,” having unknowingly retold her own experiences through her lyrics (Eilish 2023). In the interview, Eilish recalls her own challenges against gender stereotypes, mental illness, and her sexuality (Holmes 2023). As she unknowingly writes the song from her own perspective, Billie Eilish presents a raw and natural reflection of personal stories, making the song empowering and relatable. Eilish shares that “hearing people talk about how much their experience as a woman resonated with what I wrote was so sad, but I also felt less alone” (Eilish 2023). </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was I made for?” played a crucial role in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the movie, the protagonist Barbie embarks on a journey from the perfection of Barbieland into the complexities of human existence, where she confronts emotions, societal expectations, and the uncertainties of self-discovery. The song’s central sentiment of questioning identity and purpose mirrors the emotional arc of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barbie</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During one of the final scenes, Barbie is shown the joys, pains, loves, and conflicts of the real world, of human experience. In seeing each fleeting moment of womanhood projected before her, Barbie is enlightened about what it truly means to be human. As the montage scene plays, Eilish’s voice echoes in the back, symbolizing the protagonist’s evolved understanding of identity and purpose. The introspective lyrics of “What was I made for?” accompany the film in conveying the central message about embracing imperfection and vulnerability. However, despite the song’s strong ties to the film, its impact has extended beyond the motion picture, shaping its own culturally defining moment. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this chaotic and ever-changing world, perhaps some of the most powerful performances are the ones that whisper rather than shout.</span></p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright">Powered by Publii</div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
