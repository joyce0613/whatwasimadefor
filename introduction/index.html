For generations, countless children have grown up with her as the epitome of beauty, success, and perfection. However, this image of Barbie also creates restrictive ideals. In Greta Gerwig’s 2023 film, Barbie, these limitations are brought to light as the protagonist, Stereotypical Barbie, experiences an emotional revelation in understanding the realities of womanhood (Gerwig 2023). Billie Eilish’s “What was I made for?” played softly in the back, mirroring Barbie’s acceptance of the imperfections of real life. As Eilish herself admitted, the song originally written for a fictional character evolved into an opportunity to speak for herself. Eilish’s refusal to conform to hyperfeminine standards, her gender-neutral aesthetic, and her unfiltered emotional expression all challenge conventional images of female pop icons (Burns and Lafrance 2001). In projecting her own experiences of being criticized for her unconventionality, Billie Eilish created a relatable story of self-ambiguity and doubt. My project explores how “What was I made for?” creates a space to acknowledge emotional ambiguity and rather than offering answers, provides reassurance and comfort.In my Critical Reading Assignment, I analyzed Jessica A. Holmes’s “Billie Eilish and the Feminist Aesthetics of Depression” (2023). Holmes explores how Eilish’s music and public image challenge stereotypes of the female pop star image. This article discussed Eilish’s unconventional “sad girl” persona, rooted in her unique whisper singing, oversized clothing style, and emotional transparency (Holmes 2023). Building onto this argument, it should be highlighted that Eilish is not glamorizing negativity and sadness but is asserting agency in positioning the emotion as valid and normal. A compelling point that Holmes brings up in this article is Eilish’s unintentional self-insertion into her song. Accidental self-revelation is the heart of why the song resonates so strongly with its listeners, reassuring them that confusion and ambiguity are widely experienced in the search for self and purpose (Holmes 2023). I further Holmes’s argument by expanding on the potential that “What was I made for?” possesses in empowering its audience to not feel constrained by societal expectations.  This theme of personal acceptance and emotional ambiguity is further developed in my Playlist and Listening Guide, which placed Eilish’s “What was I made for?” at the transitioning core of a seven-song journey of self-reflection. The playlist explores the evolution from grief and loss to acceptance and empowerment. Opening up with the melancholic voices of Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler through “you were good to me”, we build toward self-reclamation, ending with Eilish’s “bad guy.” “What was I made for?” situates itself in the middle of the playlist and sits within the sense of uncertainty as the journey shifts towards self-agency from a period of heartbreak and doubt. In this context, “What was I made for?” doesn’t seek to offer an answer, but to encourage confrontation with the question itself: What was I made for? Each song in the compilation reflects a stage of personal development from an encounter with loss. As the playlist progresses, I hope listeners’s emotions become paralleled with the accelerating beats, feeling the exhilaration of self-acceptance.With its tremendous accomplishments, “What was I made for?” materialized its impact with an Oscars win. In my Music Review, I center my analysis around Eilish’s heartfelt Oscars performance. The performance relied primarily on a soft piano and her breathy, ASMR-like vocals. I argue that in this way, the performance becomes much more raw, as there is much more emphasis placed on Eilish’s lyricism. On this note, I expanded on Eilish’s performance techniques, in which she imbues each word and phrase with weight and intention, pausing between phrases to allow for reflection. Contrary to the idea that performances do not contribute deeper meanings to the original song, Eilish’s Oscars performance added more emotional weight as she turned the award show into a space for communal reflection. In this sense, Eilish’s unique “quietness” is more powerful than elaborate and “loud” shows.Eilish has spoken openly about the “war” of being a woman and how her experiences of being sexualized influenced the emotional honesty of the track (Stephan 2023). This honesty is exactly what touches its audiences. Through my blog post, I explore the cultural influence of “What was I made for?”, particularly regarding its reception by its young listeners. I trace the song’s presence and influence across social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, analyzing how users have interpreted and resonated with the song. The blog post adds the new “recipient’s” perspective to the analysis of the song. Through seeing the videos of girlhood, gender identity, nostalgia, personal growth, and female empowerment, we gain first-hand experience to understand the influence it has on its audience who have used it as a method to retell their own stories. In conclusion, “What was I made for?” is not about solutions, but rather about reassurance, comfort, and placing value and strength in the idea of “not knowing.” When faced with the expectations to constantly provide answers and possess certainty, perhaps asking the question “What was I made for?” can be more important than answering it.Music Video &amp; Lyrics --&gt;"><meta name="generator" content="Publii Open-Source CMS for Static Site"><link rel="canonical" href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/introduction/"><link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/feed.xml" title="Exploring &quot;What was I made for?&quot; - RSS"><link rel="alternate" type="application/json" href="https://joyce0613.github.io/whatwasimadefor/feed.json" title="Exploring &quot;What was I made for?&quot; - JSON"><meta property="og:title" content="Introduction - Exploring 'What was I made for?'
